## Add Drupal Claude Skills

Adds comprehensive skill collection for Drupal 9/10/11 development.

### What is this?

First comprehensive skill collection for Drupal CMS in the Claude Code ecosystem. Covers:
- 50+ Drupal development patterns (from Selwyn Polit's "Drupal at Your Fingertips")
- Composer-based contrib module management
- Safe configuration workflows (with critical Terminus patterns)
- DDEV local development
- Pantheon platform workflows
- OWASP Top 10 security patterns (from Ivan Grynenko)

### Changes

Add to README.md under an appropriate section (suggest creating new "CMS & Frameworks" section):

```markdown
### CMS & Frameworks

- [drupal-claude-skills](https://github.com/grasmash/drupal-claude-skills) - Comprehensive skills for Drupal 9/10/11 development including contrib management, configuration workflows, DDEV local development, Pantheon hosting, and OWASP security patterns. First skill collection specifically for Drupal CMS.
```

### Why include this?

- **Fills ecosystem gap**: No existing CMS/PHP framework skills in Claude ecosystem
- **Production-ready**: Battle-tested patterns from real Drupal projects
- **Expert-curated**: Builds on work by Selwyn Polit and Ivan Grynenko
- **Comprehensive**: 6 skills covering entire dev lifecycle
- **Well-documented**: Complete CONTRIBUTING.md, USAGE.md, professional README
- **Open source**: MIT licensed
